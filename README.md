In my studies I learn how to use this code "rm -f .git/index.lock" to fix issue on git when I try to push to github.. this message..
"Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g. an editor opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process may have crashed in this repository earlier: remove the file manually to continue."
